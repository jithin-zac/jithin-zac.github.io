I’m a passionate and results-driven Senior Software Engineer with over 6 years of experience building and scaling distributed systems. I specialize in backend infrastructure, cloud-native applications, and security, and have a strong focus on improving developer experience and system reliability. With a diverse background spanning industries from logistics to blockchain, I thrive in challenging environments where performance, security, and innovation intersect.

At Forto Logistics, I led the redesign of the company’s authentication and authorization landscape, integrating platforms like Auth0 and Open Policy Agent (OPA) to enhance security and scalability. I also played a key role in reducing system latency by 50%, improving both user experience and revenue. My journey at Forto began as an entry-level on-call engineer, growing into a core incident responder and eventually leading initiatives that improved both security and operational response times.

Prior to this, I contributed to Ernst & Young’s Blockchain Analyzer, developing backend APIs for auditing and reconciling cryptocurrency transactions. I have a deep interest in blockchain technology and have worked extensively with Ethereum and Solidity, specializing in asset tokenization.

Beyond work, I am an advocate for open-source and developer tools, having created widely used NPM packages like Gherkin Parse and Simple Keygen, which have collectively reached thousands of downloads. I’m also an active writer, sharing my thoughts on backend engineering on my personal blog. In addition, I’ve contributed to several hackathons and achieved a runner-up position in the Google Cloud Hackathon in Germany.

With a robust technical skillset in NodeJS, Golang, Kubernetes, Terraform, and cloud platforms like Azure and AWS, I am always eager to take on new challenges, whether optimizing backend systems or leading complex migrations. I hold multiple Azure certifications, underscoring my commitment to continuous learning and cloud infrastructure excellence
