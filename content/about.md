I’m Jithin Zachariah 👋 — a backend & infrastructure engineer 💻 based in Berlin 🌍. With 7+ years of experience, I’ve worked on everything from building blockchain infrastructure ⛓️ to designing secure authentication platforms 🔐 and optimising logistics systems 🚚.

I enjoy solving complex engineering challenges ⚡, especially around scalability 📈, security 🛡️, and developer experience 🛠️. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring new tech 🔎, learning about system design 🏗️, or working on side projects 🚀.
